# Local review — Claude fallback

The `lfx-local-review` host has already decided the harness and printed its pins. Launch three reviewers and nothing else. This is a launch table: review criteria, severities, floor rules and KB knowledge stay in the selected skills.

## Launch exactly three generic subagents in one parallel batch

| Role | Skill name to load |
|---|---|
| `general` | `lfx-general-code-review` |
| `repo_code` | `meeting-service-code-reviewer` |
| `repo_learnings` | `meeting-service-learnings-reviewer` |

## Give each subagent its skill by name

Tell each subagent to **load the registered skill by the name above** and follow it as its entire rulebook. Those three names are fixed; do not derive, resolve or substitute them.

Never pass an absolute reviewer-skill path, never parse frontmatter at runtime, never read a `SKILL.md` as ordinary text, never paste or restate its rules into the prompt, and never accept an ambient substitute.

**If a named skill is unavailable, fail that role loudly and treat the whole Claude cycle as invalid.** The remedy is to relaunch Claude from this repo with the project skills and the `lfx-skills` plugin registered — never to bypass skill loading by reading a path.

Forbid ambient instruction discovery, but not evidence reads directed by the loaded skill.

Pass unchanged to every subagent: `target repo`, `target_sha`, `base_sha` (or literal `none`), the exact `review exactly:` range, and any `extra` hint. Use the pins from the single harness decision; never rerun the launcher to obtain them.

A subagent error, empty result, or non-review Markdown is a role-labelled all-Claude host failure. Never call it no findings and never synthesize reviewer `INCOMPLETE`. A reviewer-returned first-line `INCOMPLETE — <reason>` passes through. Any failure invalidates the cycle; rerun all three on Claude, never one role and never a mixed harness.
